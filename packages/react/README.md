![Core CI Status](https://github.com/unicef-new-zealand/unicorn/workflows/Core%20CI/badge.svg)

Unicorn Design System is an open source design system built at UNICEF New Zealand.
We've built it with web components and stencil to ensure it works between frameworks.

## Getting Started

This package is a thin React layer for our web components. Each component is only responsible for
passing React data & events down to the underlying element.

> If you're not using React, check out [the core library](https://github.com/unicef-new-zealand/unicorn/tree/master/core).

Unicorn requires a global stylesheet to be loaded (for global typography and color vars,)
documentation for this
is a work in progress. For now, please make sure it's loaded.

To install the library:

```shell script
npm install @unicorndesign/core @unicorndesign/react
```

As of version 1.1, you no longer need to load Unicorn yourself, components are defined when
you import them from this package.
 
However, you will still need to define a theme and global styles:
```jsx
import '@unicorndesign/core/theming/prebuilt/default.css';

// OR
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@unicorndesign/core@1.0.0/theming/prebuilt/default.css">
```

Polyfills are not included by default, but the legacy loader exposes an applyPolyfills method:

```typescript
import { applyPolyfills } from '@unicorndesign/core/loader';

// Optional, depending on your browser targets 
await applyPolyfills();
``` 

Done! You're ready to use Unicorn.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { UniButton } from '@unicorndesign/react/UniButton';

export default () => (
  <UniButton icon>ðŸ¦„</UniButton>
);
```

## Development notes
If you `npm link` this package into another app, you will
encounter react hook errors, because your app's react
is a separate instance to the one this uses.
The fix:
```
# Link the react here to the target's react. This is
# roughly how it would behave as a peer-dependency
npm link ~/consumer-app/node_modules/react
npm link ~/consumer-app/node_modules/react-dom
```
